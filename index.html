							<h1>The Coffees that Made 'Merica</h1>

					<div class="textBoxRight">
						<p><span id="coffeeText">Coffee builds 'Merica. It is the fuel of innovation, the oil of change. It keeps us safe at night and keeps us awake by day. It brings joys to mornings, energy in the afternoon, delight with dessert. This is a tribute to the coffees that turned America into 'Merica.</span>

						<h2>Sanka</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="textBoxRight">
						<p><span id="coffeeText">Like the sands of wisdom that blow across the dusty plains of the Mojave, Sanka stands the test of time and delivers complex yet accessible aromatics and flavors that are both sensual and immediate. Close your eyes as you sip this liquid blessing and you'll be reminded again of all the goodness in everyday life that so often goes unnoticed. But the Sanka adventure starts even before your first sip. A deep breath of its robust cornucopia of tropic gardens and busy rooftop art shows in a hip urban neighborhood will inspire you to hitch your soul to a star and take a spiritual flight beyond your wildest dreams. It's familiar yet new every time- it's Sanka.</span></p>

						<p><span id="coffeeText">Notes: Ozone, pumpkin, roots, ground bike tires, freshly drained motor oil (10W-40), sawdust</span></p>

						<h2>Nescafe'</h2>
					</div>

					<div class="textBoxRight">
						<p><span id="coffeeText">The rain lightly pelts the windows.  You hear hushed chatterings of French, Turkish, Arabic, and English in the air.  The aroma of freshly baked croissants and baguettes takes you back to mornings at grand mama. As you savor your warm, buttery croissant, she appears.  Silhouetted in the doorway, you see her for the first time.  You have corresponded for months, but are just meeting today.You want this to be perfect, like her.  You may be retelling this story the rest of your life.</span></p>
						<p><span id="coffeeText">For life’s moments - Nescafé.</span></p>

Born from mile long warehouses in the heartland of America, McDonald’s house brew emerges as the fulfillment of every hope and dream you’ve ever had for a coffee. You’ll feel emotional at the smell and literally be in tears by your first sip. Whether you’re paragliding in Paraguay or racing dirt bikes in Romania, the signature taste of the McDonald’s house blend will always be there for you. Reassuring, relaxing, reminding you that sometimes the finest things in life come from the most ordinary of places.</span></p>

						<p><span id="coffeeText">Notes: Chlorine, July brow sweat, earth/sand, dirty mop bucket water, burnt latex, tap water, rose hips</span></p>

					<div class="titleBox">
						<h2>Maxwell House</h2>
					</div>

					<div class="textBoxRight">
						<p><span id="coffeeText">Picture a house of mahogany furniture and large area rugs from the 18th century. The fresh smell of leather and old, asbestos-filled paneling circulates through the foyer and into the kitchen. This is Maxwell’s house. And Maxwell’s coffee makes you feel right at home. Kick off your boots and pull up a seat on grandfather’s old recliner. It’s creaky, and it may break, but there’s always another cup of Maxwell brewing if you spill yours. Once you pour up a cup of this fine roast, you’ll feel a sense of delight, establishment and ease. Just like catching up with your old friend in his rustic home. A cup of Maxwell is always good to the last drop.</span></p>

						<p><span id="coffeeText">Notes: Toasted marshmallows, cozy blankets, chestnut, Visine eye drops, Old Spice, old newspaper</span></p>

						<h2>Folgers Singles</h2>
					</div>

					<div class="textBoxRight">
						<p><span id="coffeeText">Close your eyes and transport yourself to that first dip into a warm, bubbly bath after a hard day.  Your muscles are relaxed, your mind cleared, your body refreshed.  As your nose translates scents from lavender, rosemary, and hibiscus, your mouth is enveloped in the calming undertones in each cup of Folgers Singles.  A papyrus-wrapped ground and instant blend transpose simple water into a transcendental experience.  Each cup of exquisitely-brewed Folgers Singles will take you from everyday to Nirvana - truly the best part of waking up.</span></p>

						<p><span id="coffeeText">Notes: Tropical rainshower, wood pulp, musty pine, ending with oak barrel</span></p>

				<section data-background-image="i/dennys.png" data-background-transition="slide">
					<div class="titleBoxRight">
						<h2>Denny's</h2>
					</div>

					<div class="textBoxLeft">
						<p><span id="coffeeText">As iconic as the Grand Slam and Moons Over My Hammy, Denny's house brew transports you back to those 4 pm dinners with your grandparents to catch the early-bird and kids-eat-free specials.  It is praised for its utility and savored by generations, from the newspaper-reading retiree who is there every morning to the partying college student trying to recover before class.  Sourced from coffee plantations worldwide, it is best served from a glass carafe into a robust ceramic mug – as much as you want, for one low price.</span></p>

						<p><span id="coffeeText">Notes: Maple, hash brown, chicken fried steak, onion rings, Lemon Pledge, and a healthy dose of ‘Merica</span></p>

					<div class="titleBox">
						<h2>Choc' ful O' Nuts</h2>
					</div>

					<div class="textBoxRight">
						<p><span id="coffeeText">Choc' full o'Nuts is the coverall of our blends – useful, practical, industrial.  Coastal and nutty robusta conventionally grown in southeast Asia blended with earthy Central America crafts a milquetoast and fairly normal yet nutty/cocoa blend.  It weathers the rigors of the oversized peculator – flowing from the value like a smooth river winding through America's heartland. Choc' full of O Nuts stands up to non-dairy powdered creamer and sugar cubes in a styrofoam cup.  This is, perhaps, why it's the most popular blend of America's blue collar workers: serving them well, so they can serve us well.</span></p>

						<p><span id="coffeeText">Notes: Cocoa, acai berry, walnut, canvas, old furniture, stove top grease fire, silly putty</span></p>
